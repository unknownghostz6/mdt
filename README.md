## How to Install?

1. Make sure to rename the folder from mdt-main to mdt and then ensure mdt on your resources list. Also disable any other mdt script you are using.
2. Run the user_mdt SQL in your database.
3. Inside sv_mdt on line 15 you will be able to change the job required to use the mdt (default is police, only one job rn).
4. To bring up the mdt use /aa in chat and itll bring up an animation as if you were pulling out a notebook or notepad.
